# mini_shell_wip
oops i deleted readme somewhere along the line

to do:

1. Put all ARGs into a  matrix (**str)
2. Copy the info of fileout inside str_out_1
3. Pipe str_out1 and str_out2
4. Collect the answer in a file_final
5. Copy info str_final in Matrix
6. Repeat all

************************************
link the functions that we didn't have to redo ourselves (ls, sh, cat, wc)
brainstorm the structure of execute_function
pipe operator
redirections (</>)
append (>>)
heredoc (<<)
error handling needs string outputs associated with different error outputs
testing, lots of it

that might be all.
