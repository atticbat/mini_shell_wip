# mini_shell_wip
oops i deleted readme somewhere along the line

to do:
link the functions that we didn't have to redo ourselves (ls, sh, cat, wc)
brainstorm the structure of execute_function
pipe operator
redirections (</>)
append (>>)
heredoc (<<)
error handling needs string outputs associated with different error outputs
testing, lots of it

that might be all.
